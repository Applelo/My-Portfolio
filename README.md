[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4ea1fd9c-ebd3-4189-9af9-c0b3debe5db2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lois-boubault/deploys)

Portfolio based on [Gatsbt Starter Mate](https://github.com/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-mate) by [EmaSuriano](https://github.com/EmaSuriano).

You can see my portfolio at [https://lois-boubault.me](https://lois-boubault.me). This website uses Gatsby (React.js & Graphql), Redux & Contenful CMS and is deployed with Netify.

A lot addition and modification was operated so you can't use the `yarn setup` command to import Contenful datas.
